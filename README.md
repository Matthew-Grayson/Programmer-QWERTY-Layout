# Grayak Keyboard Layout

## Purpose

The Grayak Keyboard Layout is a programmer‑optimized variant of QWERTY designed to reduce symbol reach, increase typing efficiency, and make common programming characters easier to access. It preserves the familiar QWERTY letter arrangement while reorganizing the number row and symbol keys for faster access to brackets, braces, operators, and punctuation used in modern software development.

Key goals:

- Reduce finger travel for symbols frequently used in programming.
- Make the unshifted layer more expressive by placing brackets, braces, and operators on the base layer.
- Move digits to the shifted layer, where they remain easily accessible but no longer compete with high‑frequency programming symbols.
- Preserve all expected macOS behavior, including system shortcuts, Control/Command behavior, and Caps Lock affecting only letters.
- Offer a cross‑platform layout foundation that can be implemented on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

This layout is intended for developers who want to maintain QWERTY muscle memory while benefiting from a more ergonomic and efficient symbol arrangement.

## Who This Layout Is For

- Programmers who use symbols more frequently than numbers.
- Developers seeking a layout that reduces the need for awkward pinky stretches.
- Users who want to keep standard QWERTY letters, shortcuts, and spacing intact.
- Anyone transitioning from standard US QWERTY who wants an easier path than learning a full alternative layout like Dvorak or Colemak.
